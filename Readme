# Kepler Orbital Period Calculator!!
It's my first time programming in english so more people can understand my code.
 This script Calculates orbital periods using Kepler's Third Law.
Supports both circular and elliptical orbits.

## Features:
- Circular orbit calculation
- Elliptical orbit (real Kepler correction)
- Eccentricity calculation
- Orbital velocity
- Orbit classification (LEO/MEO/GEO/HEO)

## Formula:
T = 2π × √(a³/GM)

## Examples:
- ISS (400km): ~92 minutes
- GPS (20,200km): ~12 hours  
- Moon (356,500/406,700km): ~27.8 days
